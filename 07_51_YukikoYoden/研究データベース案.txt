Reference codes that begin with the letter C pertain to the composer. 
The COM code identifies the composer (surname first followed by given names).
The CDT code identifies the composer’s birth and death dates. 
A special format is used in defining such dates, and so there are accurate ways to
represent uncertainty, approximation, ranges of dates, and alternative dates. 
The Humdrum Reference Manual describes date formats in great detail.

Reference codes that begin with the letter O pertain to the work or opus. 
The OTL code identifies the title of the encoded material — in this case the 
*Les augures printaniers*. 
The OPT code identifies the parent work from which the encoded music belongs. 
The ODE code identifies the name of a person or organization to which the work was dedicated. 
All three of these records OTL, OPT and ODE are encoded using the original language.

Language designations are explicitly indicated by following a reference code 
with one or two “at” signs @ followed by a two- or three-letter language code. 
The OPT@EN code is used to provide an English translation. 
In this case, the Russian title ( Весна священная , transliterated as Vesna svyashchennaya) is translated as Rite of Spring. 
The double “at” sign (@@) is used to designate the original, primary, or preferred language.

Reference codes beginning with P pertain to publishing and imprint information. 
(Codes beginning with S can be used to identify manuscript sources, 
library or archive locations, and other source-related data.)

Codes beginning with Y identify copyright information. 
Humdrum defines separate codes for publisher of the electronic edition, 
publisher of the original source document, date of copyright, 
date of data release, country of copyright, copyright message, original copyright owner, 
original year of publication, and other information. 
The YEC reference record shown in Example 2.6 simply encodes the date and copyright owner of the electronic document.

Codes that begin with A identify analytic information concerning the document. 
The code AMT provides a metric classification. 
Meters may be classified using combinations of the following keywords: simple, compound, duple, triple, quadruple, irregular. 
The AGN code is used to provide a free-form text that helps to identify the genre of the work. 
In this case the genre is identified as ballet. 
Other suitable characterizations may include opera, string quartet, concerto, barbershop quartet, folksong, and so on. 
The AST code can be used to identify the style or period of work. 
Once again, this is a free-form text record. Suitable keywords might include 
terms such as baroque, bebop, bossa nova, Ecole Notre Dame, minimalist, 
high-life, hip-hop, reggae, etc. 
Such analytic information is obviously interpretive and often open to disagreement.
Nevertheless, explicit analytic information often proves useful in electronic documents.

An especially useful analytic reference record is the AIN record for encoding instrumentation. This reference record follows a strict syntax. Each instrument has an official Humdrum abbrevation. Appendix II identifies a number of the more common instrument codes. Instrumentation reference records always specify the instrumentation in alphabetical order by instrument abbrevation separated by a single space. For example, the instrumentation for a woodwind quintet is given as:

!!!AIN: clars corno fagot flt oboe
In our discussion here we have only identified some of the more common types of reference records. A complete description of reference records is given in Appendix II.
